        <h2>LeBron James' legacy</h2>
        <p>LeBron James isn't just a basketball player—he's a force of nature. A generational talent with a rare blend of skill, size, and IQ, he's redefined what it means to be great. From his gravity-defying dunks to his pinpoint passing, LeBron controls the game like a maestro, making every teammate better and every opponent rethink their strategy.

            But his greatness isn’t just on the court. He’s a leader, a philanthropist, and an icon. The I PROMISE School, his activism, his longevity—he’s built a legacy that extends far beyond basketball. Four rings, countless records, and a career that continues to defy time itself.
            
            LeBron James isn’t just in the GOAT debate—he is the debate.</p>
