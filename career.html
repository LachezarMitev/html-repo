        <h2>The king's career</h2>
        <p>LeBron James' career is a masterclass in dominance, longevity, and evolution. From being the most hyped prospect in history to becoming the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, he has exceeded every expectation.

            Drafted No. 1 by Cleveland in 2003, he carried the franchise to relevance, winning two MVPs before taking his talents to Miami in 2010. There, he unlocked his prime, winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, he returned to Cleveland and fulfilled his promise, leading the Cavs to a historic 2016 title.
            
            Since 2018, he's led the Lakers, securing his fourth ring in 2020. With four MVPs, four championships, and an unmatched impact on and off the court, LeBron isn’t just a legend—he is the standard. And even now, The King is still rewriting history.</p>
